        Privacy Policy for Amplihire
        1. Who we are
        Amplihire is a recruitment solution operated by Amplibit d.o.o., Ulica grada Vukovara 5/1, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia ("Amplibit", "we" or "us"). Amplihire uses WhatsApp and artificial‑intelligence (AI) driven services to help employers find and engage with job candidates. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store and disclose personal data when you apply for a role using Amplihire or interact with our AI chatbots on WhatsApp.
        We provide this notice in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Croatian Act Implementing the GDPR and other applicable data‑protection laws. Meta (owner of WhatsApp) requires developers using its platform to maintain a publicly accessible privacy policy that clearly explains what data is collected and how it is processed[1]. This policy is intended to satisfy those requirements as well as to inform candidates and clients about our practices.
        2. Information we collect
        We collect and process a wide range of personal data in order to operate our recruitment platform. The types of data we handle include:
        Personal information
        • Identity and contact details: Full name, email address, phone number, LinkedIn profile URL, current location and availability for interviews.
        • Demographic data: Age or date of birth, gender and nationality. This information is optional and is used only for equal‑opportunity monitoring or where required for visa or eligibility assessments.
        • Sensitive documents: At later stages of recruitment you may be asked to supply official documents (for example, CV/resume, driver’s licence, passport or ID card, police clearance or other certificates) to verify your identity and eligibility to work. These documents may contain sensitive personal data (such as photograph, date of birth or identification numbers).
        Professional background
        • Work experience: Details of your past employment including company names, positions held, duration of employment, responsibilities and achievements.
        • Education: Names of educational institutions, degrees or certificates obtained, fields of study and graduation years.
        • Skills and qualifications: Technical and soft skills, professional certifications, language proficiency and years of experience.
        Interview‑specific data
        • Expectations and preferences: Compensation expectations, preferred work model (remote, hybrid or on‑site), earliest possible start date and willingness to relocate.
        • Health‑related information: Any health issues or accommodations you choose to disclose that are relevant to your ability to perform the role. Because this is a special category of personal data under the GDPR, we only collect and use it with your explicit consent and in accordance with applicable employment and anti‑discrimination laws.
        • Other status information: Passport validity, confirmation of whether you accept our terms of service and responses to job‑specific eligibility questions.
        Interview process data
        • Screening responses: Text or voice answers to screening questions; we may automatically transcribe audio responses and analyse them with AI.
        • Audio quality metrics: When analysing voice responses, our AI systems may record technical quality metrics (e.g., speech‑recognition confidence, background noise or usability indicators) to help us assess the accuracy of transcriptions.
        • Conversation history: A full log of questions and your responses with timestamps, including any notes or tags added by interviewers.
        • Evaluation metrics: AI‑generated and human‑generated evaluation scores (overall performance, job‑specific skills, communication skills, relevance of experience, credibility assessments), identification of key strengths and areas for development, and content analysis of responses.
        Documents and attachments
        • CV/Resume uploads: Documents uploaded by candidates are stored securely and parsed using AI to extract structured information.
        • Interview attachments: Additional files you provide (for example, portfolios, certificates, driver’s licences or police clearances) are stored in secure object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) and used solely to verify qualifications and compliance.
        System‑generated and metadata
        • System‑generated data: AI‑generated evaluations, scoring, interview flow decisions and anomaly tracking, as well as scheduling information from integrations (such as Calendly).
        • Status and timestamps: Candidate status (e.g., applied, screening, interview stage), organisation and project associations, session identifiers, creation and modification timestamps, and technical metadata (session IDs, system logs).
        • Usage and device data: Browser or device information (IP address, device type, operating system, language settings, time zone), log data and interaction data (session start/end times, message status), which help us troubleshoot and improve the service.
        Data sources
        We obtain data directly from you, from your interactions with our website and chatbots, from documents you upload, and – with your permission – from third‑party platforms such as professional networking services or recruitment portals. We may also receive references and background information from recruiters or authorised third parties.
        We do not intentionally collect data about children. Candidates must be at least 16 years old (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction) to use Amplihire.
        3. How and why we use personal data
        Your data is processed only for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. Our uses include:
        1. Recruitment and candidate matching. We use your personal and professional information to evaluate your qualifications, skills and interests in relation to available positions, to match you with suitable roles and to communicate with you about your application. This includes parsing your CV, analysing your work history, education, skills and languages, and comparing them to role requirements. Our AI models analyse your responses and documents to extract key points, availability, preferences and strengths.
        2. Interview management and evaluation. We conduct interviews via WhatsApp or other channels and collect screening responses, conversation transcripts and evaluation scores. AI‑generated scores, anomaly detection and interview flow decisions help our recruiters focus on relevant candidates and improve interview quality. Human interviewers may also add comments and ratings.
        3. Identity verification and compliance. We may request copies of your CV, passport, driver’s licence, police clearance or other official documents to verify your identity, your right to work and your eligibility for certain roles. Sensitive data such as health information or disability accommodations is collected only where relevant and with your explicit consent. We process this information to meet legal obligations and to ensure non‑discrimination.
        4. Scheduling and communications. We use your contact details and availability to arrange interviews and meetings using tools like Calendly. We send and receive encrypted WhatsApp messages through Meta’s Cloud API. Meta acts as our data processor and will only process messages on our behalf[2]. We do not send unsolicited marketing messages or use chat data for advertising.
        5. Providing and improving our services. We use aggregated chat transcripts, usage data, system logs and evaluation metrics to develop and improve our AI models, chatbot functionality, matching algorithms and user experience. We may store session metadata and anomaly tracking to monitor system performance and detect misuse.
        6. Legal obligations and record keeping. We may process your information to comply with employment, immigration and anti‑discrimination laws or to respond to legal claims and audits. For example, retention of certain documents may be required to demonstrate lawful hiring practices or to comply with right‑to‑work checks.
        7. Consent‑based uses. Where we rely on your consent—such as storing your profile for future positions, processing special categories of data (e.g., health information) or sharing your details with multiple employers—you can withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us (see Section 9). Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing before it was withdrawn.
        Legal bases for processing
        Under the GDPR, we must identify a lawful basis for processing personal data. We rely on:
        * Legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) in matching candidates to roles, evaluating applications and providing recruitment services. We balance these interests against your rights and expectations.
        * Performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) when we process your data in order to execute recruitment services requested by you or our clients.
        * Compliance with legal obligations (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR) for employment‑law and record‑keeping requirements.
        * Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) when we ask your permission to keep your data for future positions or share it with third parties beyond what is necessary for the recruitment process.
        4. How we share personal data
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information only as described below:
        • Employers and recruiters: When you express interest in a job, we share your application data, conversation transcripts and evaluation scores with the hiring company or recruiter so that they can assess your suitability. They act as independent data controllers and are responsible for their own compliance with data‑protection laws.
        • Technology and hosting providers: We use trusted service providers to operate our platform. This includes: – Meta/WhatsApp Cloud API for sending and receiving encrypted messages; message data is stored on Meta’s servers for up to 30 days[3]. – Amazon Web Services (S3) or similar cloud storage for storing documents and attachments such as CVs, passports and police clearances.
        – OpenAI and other AI providers for processing and storing interview transcripts, generating vector embeddings and producing evaluations and insights. Vector databases may be hosted by third parties and reside outside the EEA.
        – Calendly for scheduling interviews and meetings based on your availability. – Internal message queues and databases (e.g., RabbitMQ, JSON state files) used to process and temporarily store data during the interview flow.
        Service providers are contractually required to process data solely on our instructions and to implement appropriate safeguards[4]. We carefully vet these partners and enter into data‑processing agreements incorporating Standard Contractual Clauses when required.
        • Legal compliance and protection: We may disclose information if we are required to do so by law, regulation, court order or governmental authority, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, property or safety, or those of candidates, employers or the public.
        • Business transfers: If Amplibit is involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred to the successor entity subject to appropriate confidentiality and data‑protection obligations. We will notify you of any such change if required by law.
        We may anonymise or aggregate data so that it is no longer personal; such data may be used for analytical or statistical purposes without further notice.
        5. Data retention
        We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above and to comply with legal requirements. Under the GDPR storage‑limitation principle, organisations must not keep personal data longer than needed[5]. For recruitment records, industry practice recommends retaining data for 6–12 months for unsuccessful applicants[6].
        Our retention policy is as follows:
        • WhatsApp messages: Meta’s Cloud API stores messages and associated identifiers for up to 30 days for retransmission; after that, they are deleted[3]. We copy messages into our secure databases to evaluate applications.
        • Candidate records and evaluations: Unless you ask us to retain your profile for future opportunities, we delete or anonymise your candidate data, interview transcripts, AI‑generated evaluations and scoring 12 months after the end of the recruitment process for a particular role (or earlier where local law requires). This period allows us to respond to legal claims and perform audits[6]. If you are hired, your data becomes part of the employer’s personnel records and is retained according to their policies.
        • Official documents and sensitive data: Copies of passports, driver’s licences, police clearances and health‑related information are retained only as long as necessary to verify identity and eligibility or to comply with legal obligations. In most cases these documents are deleted within 6 months after completion of the recruitment process unless a longer period is required by law. We store such documents in secure encrypted storage and limit access to authorised staff only.
        • CVs, resumes and other attachments: CVs and resumes are stored for up to 12 months (unless you consent to longer retention) and then deleted or anonymised. Additional attachments such as portfolios, certificates or supporting documents are deleted once they are no longer needed for the recruitment process.
        • Usage and analytics data: We retain aggregated usage data, logs, system metadata and anonymised AI training data for up to 2 years for security, analytics and service‑improvement purposes, after which it is either deleted or anonymised.
        Backup copies may persist for a limited time but will not be restored to active systems after deletion deadlines[7].
        6. International data transfers
        We are based in Croatia and generally store data in the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of our service providers (including Meta) may store or process data outside the EEA. Meta states that its Cloud API messages are processed on servers in Meta data centres and that appropriate GDPR‑compliant transfer mechanisms are in place[8]. When we transfer personal data to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other appropriate safeguards. You can obtain a copy of these safeguards by contacting us.
        7. Data security
        We implement technical and organisational measures designed to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. These include encryption of data in transit (e.g., WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol to encrypt messages[9]), access controls, pseudonymisation of candidate data and secure development practices. Service providers are required to meet industry‑standard security obligations[4]. Despite these measures, no system is 100 % secure; we therefore cannot guarantee absolute security.
        8. Your rights
        Under the GDPR and Croatian law, you have the following rights:
        1. Right of access: Obtain confirmation of whether we process your personal data and receive a copy of that data.
        2. Right to rectification: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
        3. Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"): Request deletion of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for us to continue processing it.
        4. Right to restrict processing: Ask us to suspend processing in certain circumstances (e.g., while a request for rectification is reviewed).
        5. Right to data portability: Obtain a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used format and transfer it to another controller.
        6. Right to object: Object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.
        7. Right to withdraw consent: Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.
        8. Right to lodge a complaint: You may lodge a complaint with the Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency (AZOP) or another supervisory authority if you believe we have violated data‑protection laws.
        9. How to exercise your rights or contact us
        To exercise any of your rights or raise questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
        * Email: privacy@amplibit.com
        * Postal address: Amplibit d.o.o., Ulica grada Vukovara 5/1, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia
        When you request deletion of your data, we will honour your request unless we are legally required to retain certain information (e.g., to comply with employment law or to defend legal claims). Meta’s developer policies require us to offer a clear way for users to request data deletion[10].
        10. Changes to this policy
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements or data‑processing practices. We will post the updated policy on our website and indicate the date of the latest revision. Significant changes will be notified to you via WhatsApp or email. Your continued use of Amplihire after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
